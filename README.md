A unique website management system for Habbo Fansites.

----------
## Overview ##
Hello and welcome to the source code of FansitePal. So far, all the PHP coded is either coded by Ollie or other contributors (credit at end). If you feel you should be credited for any work please email me at Ollie@TigerWebs.co.uk

This is my first MVC styled application and is a big learning curve for me so hopefully it turns out well. If you have any questions then feel free to email me on the same email as above, and if you find any issues please report them.

## Features ##

 - Interchangeable themes
 - Usersystem complete with main UserSys features
 - Custom forum system (linked with Usersystem Accounts)
 - Admin/Staff panel, also linked to UserSystem
 - User created plugins, creating almost a 'community' of developers
 
 ### Technical Breakdown ###
 For all you geeks out there.
-  Follow MVC Architecture
- Twig template engine
- OOP Followed
- Using PDO + Prepared Statements BUT with a Custom Wrapper Class
- Full documentation
- PHP 5.5

This is completely open-sourced and fully editable for you to use. Just please leave credit. Anyone found not leaving credit will not be supported in this, as I don't think its fair to use, for example, Twig's Templating Engine and not give them credit.
